<p>Hello! My name is Victor. I spent 8 years in the U.S Army Infantry and 5 years as a Deputy Sheriff in Washington State where I currently reside. There was a point that I thought going to traditional college was a must and it took me 3 years of Accounting classes to realize I hated it.  I have owned 2 restaurants, taught High School, driven for Uber, Delivered packages for Amazon and worked for the Electrical Workers Union. Computers have always been my passion.  I want to understand how they work and how to make them do the things I want them to.  So here I am.</p>
